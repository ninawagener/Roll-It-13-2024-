To begin, decide on a score goal (eg: The first one to get a 
score of 50 wins).

For each round of the game, you win points by rolling dice.
The winner of the round is the one who gets 13 (or slightly less).

If you win the round, then your score will increase by the
number of points that you earned. If your first roll of two 
dice is  double (eg: both dice show a three), then your score
will be DOUBLE the number of points.

If you lose the round, then you don't get any points.

If you and the computer tie (eg: you both get a score of 11,
then you will have 11 points added to your score
